## :book: About

**STELLA.ai** is an intelligent system that automatically segments brain lesions using the uploaded CT scan. We harness the power of computer vision and machine learning to extract the brain lesion segmentation points of stroke, whether it's an ischemic or hemorrhagic type of stroke. We built this application from the ground up to an actual implementation in a usable desktop application.

We're strategizing to train two models to align with the system's goals: the U-Net model and Mask RCNN. Given the available datasets, adjustments will be made to the U-Net model to optimize its performance due to differing dimensions. On the other hand, the Mask RCNN has achieved an impressive 80% Intersection over Union (IoU) accuracy in segmenting brain lesions.

In classifying strokes, we're utilizing the Hounsfield Scale, a linear transformation of the original linear attenuation coefficient measurement. Here, the radiodensity of distilled water at standard pressure and temperature (STP) is set as 0 Hounsfield units (HU), while air at STP is defined as -1000 HU. This approach aids in determining the density value of lesion tissue by calculating the mean of the segmented area through the summation of all pixel values.

## What's New? STELLA.ai v1.1

 **STELLAmulator Beta**

![alt text](<2024-08-17 20-42-39 (1).gif>)

STELLAmulator (Stroke Tomography for Enhanced Lesion Learning Analysis Simulator) is an advanced tool tailored for Radiologic Technologist students. It offers an interactive and efficient learning experience in stroke identification and classification.

Students are challenged to identify strokes by marking lesions on Brain CT Scans and classifying the stroke type. Their performance is then evaluated by STELLA's AI model, providing feedback on the accuracy of their stroke identification and classification.
